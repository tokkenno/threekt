# threekt
ThreeKt (Provisional name) is 3D Engine based on ThreeJs and implemented as Kotlin Multiplatform library. 

The goal is not to achieve a 1:1 port, but to modularise and write more maintainable code, to serve as a code base that can be run on the web (WebGL), desktop (OpenGL, Vulkan) and headless environments (Software) for simulations.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. It's use is discouraged.

## Current goals

- [ ] Port the core and math packages, and classes to get basic operation.
- [ ] Implement WebGL renderer for Js target.
- [ ] Implement a software renderer for JVM target.
